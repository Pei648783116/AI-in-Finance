Read and study the following material in quercus:
-Linear Models for Price Prediction Mechanics.pptx
-log_regression_with_grid.py in LinearModelMechanics.rar
-Financial Metrics.pptx

open and run SVC_mod.ipynb
Open and run svc_mod_grid_incomplete.py (will take some time to run)
If you have trouble running these programs try setting n_jobs=None instead of -1
Windows sometimes object to the setting of n_jobs=-1
Make sure you understand what these programs are doing

You will now add some code to svc_mod_grid_incomplete.py to be able to trade
the signals that the machine learning model (SVC) is generating

The following instructions are about svc_mod_grid_incomplete.py:
After you run the code once 
Comment out the code from line 105 to 188 
by placing three double quotes before and after these lines 
(the commented out code will turn green in Spyder)

Use the information on lines 76 to 104 to:
calculate and print CAGR (formula is in Financial Metrics.pptx)
Calculate and print Sharpe_ratio (formula is in Financial Metrics.pptx)
plot the Df["Cumulative_returns"] (the equity curve of the trading strategy)
Note: in order to plot better, the returns are multiplied by 100, but this is only for visibility

Un comment the lines 105 to 142
In a similar fashion to the code in 76 to 104
use the SVC in lines 105 to 142 and calculate:

Predicted_signals (predicted by the fitted SVC)
return (=log returns of the asset being traded)
Strategy_Return (returns of trading strategy)
return_mean (mean of the returns of trading strategy)
return_std (standard deviation of the returns of the trading strategy)
start_date (of the testing)
end_date (of the testing)
days (of the testing)
period (days in a year)
years (number of years)
annualization_factor (for the Sharpe Ratio formula, see Financial Metrics.pptx)
cummulative_returns (equity curve of the strategy)
begin_balance (of the cumulative returns)
ending_balance (of the cumulative returns)
calculate and print the CAGR (see Financial Metrics.pptx)
Calcualte and print the Sharpe_ratio (see Financial Metrics.pptx)

Plot the Df['Cumulative_returns']

Which result is better, the first or the second one and why?
answer this question in a comment preceded  by # at the very bottom of the file

After you finish coding, save your code with the name
svc_mod_grid_complete.py
place this file in the original folder (SVMModelMechanics1) along with
the rest of the original files
make a zip (or rar) of the whole folder and upload it to the link provided in quercus
remember to put your name and that of your team mate (if you have one)
as the name of the zip (or rar) file
